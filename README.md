# WB LinkedIn

## Purpose

This repo has data and a draft report on the LinkedIn data released in collaboration with the World Bank.

The purpose of the report is to assess the similarity between the LinkedIn data on the Swedish labour market and Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen data on job vacancies.

## Process

I've created a report, readable in the Github pages section of this repo, that presents the LinkedIn data from two sources. The underlying data is available in the `data/` folder. have a look at the `data-index.txt` file for more info.
