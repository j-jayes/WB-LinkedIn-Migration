# What extent of the Swedish labour market do Arbetsformedling's job ads cover?

We want to know whether the job ads on Arbetsformedlingen's Platsbanken are representative of the entire Swedish labour market.

One way to establish this we can look at another source of job data in Sweden and compare the contents of these adverts.

```{r, fig.cap="Overlap in job data"}
# include_graphics("slides/slide-diagram.jpg")
```


## Data sources

We will use data from the social networking site [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). There are two sources of information that we will examine, the first is focussed on Sweden specifically, while the second is aggregated data from all of the countries in which LinkedIn operates. The first source is called the [LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise 2022 Report](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-jobs-rise-2022-10-roles-growing-demand-sweden-/) covering the 10 roles that are growing in demand in Sweden.

## Jobs on the Rise

This report measures the job titles "experiencing the highest growth rates from January 2017 through July 2021". It also provides information about the people who fill these jobs with these titles currently, based on the infomation on LinkedIn.

### What are the fastest growing jobs?

The report states that these 10 are the fastest growing jobs in Sweden.

```{r}
df <- read_rds("data/jobs_on_the_rise.rds")


df %>%
  select(rank, title) %>%
  reactable::reactable(
    columns = list(
      title = colDef(name = "Title"),
      rank = colDef(name = "Rank", maxWidth = 100)
    ),
    bordered = TRUE,
    highlight = TRUE
  )
```


### What are skills for these jobs?

```{r}
df %>%
  select(title, most_common_skills) %>%
  separate_rows(most_common_skills, sep = ",") %>%
  mutate(most_common_skills = str_squish(most_common_skills)) %>%
  group_by(title) %>%
  mutate(rn = str_c("Skill_", row_number())) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = rn, values_from = most_common_skills) %>% 
  reactable::reactable(
      # height = 500,
      defaultPageSize = 10,
    defaultColDef = colDef(
      header = function(value) gsub("_", " ", value, fixed = TRUE),
      cell = function(value) format(value, nsmall = 1),
      align = "left",
      minWidth = 70,
      headerStyle = list(background = "#f7f7f8")
    ),
    columns = list(
      title = colDef(minWidth = 140,
                     align = "left") # overrides the default
    ),
    bordered = TRUE,
    highlight = TRUE
  )
```



### Methodology

The methodology section of the report states that:

<blockquote>

LinkedIn Economic Graph researchers examined millions of jobs started by LinkedIn members from 1 January 2017 to 31 July 2021 to calculate a growth rate for each job title. To be ranked, a job title needed to see consistent growth across our membership base, as well as have grown to a meaningful size by 2021. Identical job titles across different seniority levels were grouped and ranked together. Internships, volunteer positions, interim roles and student roles were excluded, and jobs where hiring was dominated by a small handful of companies in each country were also excluded.

</blockquote>


Definitions:

<blockquote>

The Industry Skills Needs metric captures which skills are most likely to be added to a member's profile in one industry compared to other industries. It's calculated using an adapted version of a text mining technique called Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). This method gives more weight to a skill for an industry if more members in the industry list the skill on their profiles and the skill is more unique to the industry. The skills included are those added while a member holds a particular occupation (the skill flow approach). While the skill flow approach creates a trade-off whereby long-held basic skills, such as Microsoft Office being given a lesser weight, the approach is shown to be stronger at identifying the latest emerging skills in a specific industry than including all historical skills that are added during prior occupations. On balance, since the objective of this metric is to detect the latest skills needs, a skill flow approach is adopted.
